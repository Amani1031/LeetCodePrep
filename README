TIPS:
- There is a Counter() mechanism in Collections which can be added and subtracted to find differences. The Counter()
  creates an object which counts the occurance of each unique character in a string.

 - USING DICRIONARIES: you can use two dictionaries instead of one to make reverse mapping eaiser. To look things up,
 use the "in" function similar to python lists.

 - you can use the following three in a for - each python loop:
        - range()
        - enumerate() which allows you to keep track of the index and the iritable object of that index
        - zip() which creates a tuple that you can use to keep track of 2 iritable variables.
